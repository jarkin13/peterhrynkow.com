When designing components in React, there are a number of different ways to render child elements. You could require the consumer to supply an array prop and let the component decide what to render or allow the consumer to compose child elements using the `children` prop. There are other, more advanced approaches as well. Let's look at a few different options.

#### Array or object prop

Flexibility: üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using an `array` or `object` prop to render child elements is the least flexible option because the component itself controls the type of children that are rendered and their props. This approach is suitable for component libraries that prioritize consistency over flexibility because the component controls all aspects of rendering.

Here the component is saying: **Just give me the data ‚Äî I'll take care of rendering the children.**

  class="codepen"
  data-height="416"
  data-theme-id="dark"
  data-default-tab="js"
  data-user="peterhry"
  data-slug-hash="ErbYLL"
  style="height: 416px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

In this example, the consumer provides an array of items and the `Tabs` component decides what to render. This makes it difficult for the consumer to override the appearance and behavior of the tabs.

#### Children Prop

Flexibility: üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using the `children` prop to compose child elements is idiomatic in React. This approach is a bit more flexible because it lets the consumer render the children. However, the result is a tight coupling between the component and its children. For the component to control its children, they must expose the necessary props or interface.

Here the component is saying: **Give me the children and I'll slot them in somewhere. Just make sure they expose the required props so I can set them**.

<p
  class="codepen"
  data-height="416"
  data-theme-id="dark"
  data-default-tab="js"
  data-user="peterhry"
  data-slug-hash="omowzK"
  style="height: 416px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

In this example, the consumer wants to use `FancyTab` components instead of `Tab` components. This works because `FancyTab` exposes the required props `selected` and `onClick`.

#### Render Prop

Flexibility: üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using a render prop to compose child elements is an advanced pattern that delegates all aspects of rendering to the consumer. Furthermore, it results in a loose coupling between the component and its children, allowing the consumer to render children with an otherwise incompatible API.

Here the component is saying: **Render the children when I call this function. I'll expose an API to help you integrate your super-custom child components.**

<p
  class="codepen"
  data-height="416"
  data-theme-id="dark"
  data-default-tab="js"
  data-user="peterhry"
  data-slug-hash="bzYRBW"
  style="height: 416px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

In this example, the consumer wants to use custom `HoverTab` components, but there‚Äôs one problem: The `HoverTab` component exposes an `onMouseEnter` prop instead of `onClick` and an `active` prop instead of `selected`. The consumer needs a way to adapt one API to another. **This is where render props come in handy.**

When the `Tabs` component is rendering, it invokes the `children` prop (now a function) and passes it `selectedIndex` and `setSelectedIndex`. This allows the consumer to map the `HoverTab` props to the API provided by the `Tabs` component.

#### Which approach is best?

It depends whether your component library prioritizes consistency or flexibility. If you want to lock-down the design and behaviour of your components then an `array` prop might be best. If you want to provide your users with ultimate flexibility, then go for a render prop.
