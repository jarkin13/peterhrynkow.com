Recently, I was asked why using a framework or library like React, Angular, or Vue.js is better than vanilla JavaScript. Here's my take:

### Frameworks and libraries provide battle-tested solutions to common problems 

Server-side rendering, templating, routing â€” these arenâ€™t easy problems to solve but they arenâ€™t new either. Smart people have spent thousands of hours working on these problems. The frameworks and libraries they've produced as a result have been tested for things like security, browser compatibility, and performance. So why not stand on the shoulders of giants? By using a framework or library, your team can focus on delivering valuable features instead of wasting time and money reinventing the wheel.

### Frameworks guide best-practices for security 

Many frameworks provide a layer of protection against cross-site scripting (XSS). For instance, React uses automatic escaping to prevent developers from rendering untrusted HTML in the DOM. It's not bulletproof but it means that a developer with no knowledge of XSS is less likely to shoot themselves in the foot. 

With vanilla JavaScript, this layer of protection doesn't exist. All it takes is an inexperienced developer to set `innerHTML` with some contaminated markup and ðŸ’¥ you just got pwned.

### Frameworks guide best-practices for accessibility 

In addition to written guidelines, most frameworks provide plugins or tooling to improve accessibility. For example, Create React App comes with an eslint config that checks your code for common accessibility issues. While this doesn't guarantee AAA accessibility conformance, it at least points developers in the right direction. 

Some argue that accessibility is an afterthought in most frameworks. Even if thatâ€™s true, **an afterthought is still better than no thought at all.** ðŸ˜Ž

### Frameworks provide a common lexicon 

After using a framework for a while, you start to speak its language. Components, props, state â€” these mean the same thing in any React project. Having a common lexicon improves communication and helps new team members ramp-up quickly.

### Frameworks are inevitable

There is a tipping point in most software projects where if you didn't start with a framework, you inevitably start building one by accident. As you add more features, complexity creeps up and you start generalizing areas of your code. Keep doing that for a while and what you end up with is something that looks like a framework.

Think about the features you could have been building while you were busy debugging that DOM manipulation code. Again, using frameworks and libraries allows you to focus on valuable features instead of reinventing the wheel.

### Frameworks have opinions

The are so many ways to develop a modern web application that starting a project from scratch is overwhelming. How should your files be organized? How should your build scripts be configured? Opinionated frameworks like Ember make these decisions for you. That way your team can focus on whatâ€™s most important: building a great product.
