Whatâ€™s the best way to write tests for your React application so that you can feel confident deploying it to production? This is something Iâ€™ve been pondering for a while now so I thought Iâ€™d share my thoughts on the subject.

### Tools
For unit and integration tests, I like [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) because its guiding principles encourage a black-box testing approach. By writing tests this way, you can easily refactor your code without breaking your tests. In contrast, Enzyme has methods like [`setState`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/setState.html) and [`state`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/state.html) that might tempt you to test a componentâ€™s internals.

For E2E tests, Cypress.io is pretty good but more on that later.

### What to test
I see a lot of Redux apps where separate unit tests are created for components, action creators, reducers, and selectors. This is the procedure described in the [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests) so it shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise that a lot of teams follow it. Thereâ€™s a problem with this method, however.

Testing these elements separately, doesnâ€™t ensure that your app will behave as expected when you put them together. Moreover, what I often find is that the code connecting these elements (`mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, etc.) is left untested.

Action creators, reducers, and selectors are component implementation details that shouldnâ€™t be tested directly. Instead, I treat each component as a black box and test it from the outside. Doing so covers the code in each element as well as the code that connects them.

Iâ€™m not the first person to consider this approach to testing a Redux app. See [this thread](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/2179) in the Redux repo.

Unit tests make sense if you intend to package your code and publish it to npm, but for testing application behavior, integration tests are more likely to catch problems.
