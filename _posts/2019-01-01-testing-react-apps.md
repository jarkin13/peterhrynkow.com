What is the best way to write tests for your React application so that you can be confident deploying it to production? This is something Iâ€™ve been pondering for a while now so I thought Iâ€™d share my thoughts on the subject.

### Tools

There are so many different tools available for testing React apps that it can be overwhelming when you start writing tests.

For unit and integration tests, I like [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) because its guiding principles encourages a black-box testing approach. By writing tests this way, you can easily refactor your code without breaking your tests. Iâ€™ve also used enzyme in the past but found its API confusing.

For E2E test Cypress.io is pretty good.

### Redux

I see a lot of Redux apps where components, actions, reducers, and selectors are tested as separate units. This is the approach described in the [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests) so it shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise that a lot of teams follow this direction. I recommend a different approach, however.

Testing these elements separately doesnâ€™t ensure that your app will behave as expected when you put them together. Moreover, what I often see is that testing the integration between these elements is neglected. For this reason. I think unit tests make sense if you intend to package your code and publish it to npm, but for testing application behavior, integration tests are more likely to catch problems.
