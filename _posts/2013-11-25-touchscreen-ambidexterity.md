Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about the ergonomics of mobile interfaces. We know that roughly [80% of the world is right handed](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-more-people-right/), so should handedness be a consideration when designing our mobile experiences?

In my opinion, responsive design is about more than adapting to different screen sizes; itâ€™s about adapting to human factors, too. So shouldnâ€™t our interfaces adapt to handedness?

This question led me to what I thought was a clever idea: a JavaScript library that detects handedness by analyzing how the user touches the screen. A simple swipe gesture can reveal which hand is being used by observing the start and end position of the thumb. With this information, one could design a flexible interface that adapts to the the userâ€™s handedness. In theory, ergonomics could be improved by moving certain controls from one side of the screen to the other. I thought I was really on to something but then I did a little more research.

One [study](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php) I found showed that people will often switch between their left and right hand depending on the task, their posture, and environment. I actually noticed myself doing this while laying in bed this morning. I was laying on my right side which made it difficult to use my dominant hand. The interface was reversed but somehow I was managing to get by using my left hand.

I began to wonder, does our environment force us to use the opposite hand so often that weâ€™ve all gained a degree of touchscreen ambidexterity? Think of all the situations where your dominant hand is occupied with another task (holding grocery bags or the handrail on a bus) and youâ€™re forced to hold your phone with the other hand.

Is there potential to optimize interfaces based on which hand is being used at any given time? Maybe. But I think it gets complicated when you consider that users are switching hands throughout the day. Constantly changing the interface might just confuse people.
