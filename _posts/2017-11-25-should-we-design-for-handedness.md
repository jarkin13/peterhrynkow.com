Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about the ergonomics of mobile interfaces. We know that roughly [80% of the world is right handed](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-more-people-right/), so should handedness be a consideration when designing our mobile experiences?

In my opinion, responsive design is about more than adapting to different screen sizes; itâ€™s about adapting to human factors, too. So shouldnâ€™t our interfaces adapt to handedness?

This question led me to what I thought was a clever idea: a JavaScript library that detects handedness by analyzing how the user touches the screen. A simple swipe gesture can reveal which hand is being used by observing the start and end position of the thumb. With this information, one could design a flexible interface that adapts to the the userâ€™s handedness. In theory, ergonomics could be improved by moving certain controls from one side of the screen to the other. I thought I was really on to something but then I did some research.

One [study](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php) I found showed that people will often switch between their left and right hand depending on the task, their posture, and environment. Think of all the situations where your dominant hand is occupied with another task (holding grocery bags or the handrail on a bus) and youâ€™re forced to hold your phone with the other hand.

I actually observed myself doing this today. I was laying on the couch on my right side which made it difficult to hold my phone with my dominant hand. It was definitely more difficult to use the interface with my left hand and I wondered if there was an opportunity to improve this experience.

Is there potential to optimize interfaces based on which hand is being used at any given time? Maybe. But I think it gets complicated when you consider that users are switching hands throughout the day. Constantly changing the interface might just confuse people.
