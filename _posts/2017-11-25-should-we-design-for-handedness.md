Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about the ergonomics of mobile devices and I wanted to know if left-handed people have more difficulty using some websites. I wondered, if [80% of the world is right handed](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-more-people-right/), could the design of mobile interfaces be favoring right-handed users?

After doing some research, I realized that I was asking the wrong question. One [study](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php) found that people actually switch how they hold their phone depending on the task, their posture, and environment. For example, a right-handed user might hold their phone in their left hand while holding groceries in their right. So perhaps a better question to ask, is whether the design of a mobile interface favors one way of holding a device.

Later that day, I was browsing twitter when I noticed that I was holding my phone in my left hand. I decided to pay special-attention to the user experience. Some things like scrolling were easy but reaching the top-right corner of the screen was almost impossible without adjusting my grip. Had the controls been placed on the left side of the screen, I might have had an easier time.

### Can this experience be improved?

We know that responsive design is about adapting our interfaces to different screen sizes and device capabilities, but what if we took it a step further and adapted our interfaces to human factors like how the user is holding their device. Could we design a flexible interface where important controls are placed on one side of the screen or the other to improve ergonomics?

### Letâ€™s write some code!

I wanted to see if this was possible so I began by experimenting with some JavaScript that tries to detect which hand is being used by watching how the user touches the screen. What I found was that a simple swipe gesture can reveal which hand is being used by observing the start and end position of the thumb. You can find the code on GitHub. I call it [digits.js](https://github.com/peterhry/digits.js).


### Is it worth it?

Is there potential to optimize interfaces based on which hand is being used at any given time? Maybe. But I think it gets complicated when you consider that users are switching hands throughout the day. Constantly changing the interface might just confuse people.
