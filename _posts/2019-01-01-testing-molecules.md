Whatâ€™s the best way to write tests for your React application so that you can feel confident deploying it to production? What tools should you use and where should you focus your testing effort? These are questions Iâ€™ve been pondering for a while now so I thought Iâ€™d share my thoughts on the subject.

### Tools
For unit and integration tests, I like [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) because its guiding principles encourage a black-box testing approach. By writing tests this way, you can easily refactor your code without breaking your tests. In contrast, [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) has methods like [`setState`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/setState.html) and [`state`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/state.html) that might tempt you to test a componentâ€™s internal implementation.

For E2E tests, Cypress.io is pretty good but more on that later.

### What not to test
I see a lot of Redux apps where separate unit tests are created for components, action creators, reducers, and selectors. It shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise that a lot of teams follow this approach since itâ€™s whatâ€™s described in the [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests). But thereâ€™s a problem with this method.

Testing these elements separately, doesnâ€™t gurantee that your app will behave as expected when you bring them together. For example, a unit test for an [async action creator](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests#async-action-creators) can assert that a particular action was dispatched, but it doesnâ€™t gurantee that a reducer will handle said action. Moreover, what I typically find is that the code connecting a component to the store (`mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, etc.) is left untested.

Action creators, reducers, and selectors are component implementation details that shouldnâ€™t be tested directly. So what should be tested?

### What to test

This is a great piece of wisdom from Guillermo Rauch.

Think of it like this: Instead of writing a unit test for every _atom_ in your application, zoom out a bit and write some integration tests for the _molecules_. Action creators, reducers, and selectors are atoms that when combined form a connected component molecule. By testing the molecule youâ€™re also testing its atoms, but more importantly, youâ€™re ensuring that those atoms work together.

Itâ€™s best to think of a component as a black box and test its behavior from the UI. The component under test might be made up of many smaller components as well as dependencies (reducers, action creators, etc.) but with the help of a code coverage tool, you can verify that these elements are covered by your tests.

Unit tests still make sense if you intend to package your code and publish it to npm, but for testing application behavior, integration tests are more likely to catch problems.

More to come.

### Snapshot testing
One thing Iâ€™ve observed is that itâ€™s easy to create a snapshot test for a component, but hard to debug it when it fails. The diff produced by a failing snapshot test can be difficult to read, particularly for large components. For this reason, I will avoid creating a snapshot test for a large branch of components.

Perhaps a side effect of difficult debugging is that snapshots are often updated blindly during a refactor because the developer assumes the changes were intentional.
