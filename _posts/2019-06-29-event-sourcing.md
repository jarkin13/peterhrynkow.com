Migrations have been a persistent pain point for our team as we move toward an event-driven architecture. The added operational overhead of replaying events from Kafka in order to populate read models in Elasticsearch is tedious, hard to automate, and prone to human-error.

Needless to say, I was excited when I came across this talk by David Schmitz (funny guy, btw) that suggests you don't need static read models in some cases.

By creating many smaller event streams, you can get good performance reading a stream in realtime (i.e. no need for static read models). The advantage is consistent reads and less operational overhead (no need to replay events)
