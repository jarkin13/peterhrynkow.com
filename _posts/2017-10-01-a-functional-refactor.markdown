With the rise in popularity of libraries like React, a lot of JavaScript developers are learning about functional programming. Having wrote imperative code for most of my career, it took some time for me to get comfortable with functional programming. Now, it has completely changed the way I think about and write software.

Functional code is cacheable, easy to test, easy to reason about, and more elegant than imperative code. In this post Iâ€™m going to show you some lessons Iâ€™ve learned and how you can refactor your JavaScript to be more functional.

Before we get started, itâ€™s important to know about pure functions. If youâ€™re unsure what these are, there is a great chapter in [this book](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/ch3.html#oh-to-be-pure-again) on the topic.

### 1. Donâ€™t mutate function arguments

Here we have a function that takes an array of numbers and adds `10` to each value. This function is impure because it has a side effect: It mutates the `numbers` array that we pass to it.

```js
function addTen(numbers) {
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    numbers[i] += 10;
  }
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

addTen(numbers);
console.log(numbers);
// [11, 12, 13, 14]
```

To make this function pure we need to return a new array, instead of mutating the original. This is where `Array.map` comes in handy. It creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the calling array.


```js
const addTen = numbers => numbers.map(number => number + 10);
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const numbersPlusTen = addTen(numbers);

console.log(numbers);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(numbersPlusTen);
// [11, 12, 13, 14]
```

### 2. Avoid control structures

This function is pure but written in an imperative style. Functional programming avoids control structures such as loops and conditional statements.

```js
function sum(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }

  return sum;
}
```

Using `Array.reduce` is shorter and more elegant.

```js
const sum = numbers => numbers.reduce((total, number) => total + number);
```


### 3. Push side effects to the edges

Here we have a simple application where clicking a button updates a counter. The `incrementBy` and `addTen` functions are impure because they modify a variable outside of their scope.

This program is simple enough that we can tell what happens when the button is clicked, but in a more complex application, impure functions and their side effects make it difficult to keep track of changes to state.


```js
class App {
  constructor(button) {
    this.counter = 0;

    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.incrementBy(1);
      this.addTen();
    });
  }

  incrementBy(amount) {
    this.counter += amount;
  }

  addTen() {
    this.counter += 10;
  }
}
```

Notice what happens when we refactor the application to use pure functions. We push the side effects to the edges. Now, `this.counter` is only changed in one place and the code is a little easier to reason about.

```js
class App {
  constructor(button) {
    this.counter = 0;

    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.counter = this.addTen(this.incrementBy(this.counter, 1));
    });
  }

  // Pure
  incrementBy(number, increment) {
    return number + increment;
  }

  // Pure
  addTen(number) {
    return number + 10;
  }
}
```

This tweet hits the nail on the head. How does this apply to the refactored code?

1. Gather information (click events, current state)
2. Make decisions (determine new state from pure functions)
3. Act (assign new state)

For a program to be useful, we canâ€™t eliminate side effects entirely.
