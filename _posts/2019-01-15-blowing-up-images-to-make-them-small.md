Normally, raster images look distorted or pixelated when enlarged â€” especially if they contain graphics or text â€” but the technique I'm about to show you is all about blowing up tiny images and the results might surprise you.

Letâ€™s say you want to use this image as a full page background on your website:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080.jpg" />
`1920x1080.jpg (22 KB)`

To reduce the file size and support resolution-independent scaling, it would be ideal to use a vector format. Sadly, mesh gradients are not supported in SVG or CSS.

Fortunately, there's another way to achieve both a small file size and scaling using a raster image.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. Downsample the image so its dimensions are `32x18`
1. Export the image as a PNG. The resulting file <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/32x18.png" /> should be around `1 KB`.
1. Use the `32x18` image as a CSS background image that covers its container:
```css
.my-background {
  width: 1920px;
  height: 1080px;
  background: url(32x18.png);
  background-size: cover;
}
```
or as an `<img>` element:
```xml
  <img src="32x18.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
```

Here is the result:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/32x18.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`32x18.png (1443 bytes)`

Can you tell the difference? As you can see, the stretched image looks almost identical to the original. In fact, it scales up infinitely without any loss in fidelity. Better yet,
the new image is only `1.4KB` â€” that's a 93.6% reduction ðŸŽ‰. [Click here](https://codepen.io/peterhry/pen/maaXZX) for a side by side comparison.

Here is another example:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080-2.jpg" />
`1920x1080-2.jpg (143 KB)`

Notice how this image has a bit more detail than the previous one. In this case, the small image will need to be a bit larger `(128x72)` to capture the detail. Finding the right size takes some experimenting.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/128x72.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`128x72.png (7 KB)`

This technique is also suitable for blurred background photos â€” the kind you typically see combined with a text overlay. In this case, saving the image as a jpeg yields a smaller file size.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080-4.jpg" />
`1920x1080-4.jpg (199 KB)`

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/256x144-4.jpg" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`256x144-4.jpg (10 KB)`

### Limitations

Before you get too excited, this technique does have one limitation. It works well for images with smooth gradients and few details but look what happens if you blow up this image:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080-3.jpg" />
`1920x1080-3.jpg (337 KB)`

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/128x72-2.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`128x72-2.png (21 KB)`

### Whatâ€™s going on here?

_Disclaimer: I know very little about image scaling algorithms so please excuse my ignorance when I try to explain how this works._

When the downsampled image is enlarged, the browser uses an [interpolation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling#Algorithms) to fill in the missing image data. Images with less detail yield better results because the interpolated pixels end up being closer to the original ones.

### Final thoughts

This technique is great for reducing the file size of background images which typically contain less detail. It's also great for rendering lightweight, scalable mesh gradients â€” something you can't do with SVG or CSS.

So the next time you're about to export a big background image from Photoshop or Sketch â€” give this technique a try â€” you might be surprised how well it works.
