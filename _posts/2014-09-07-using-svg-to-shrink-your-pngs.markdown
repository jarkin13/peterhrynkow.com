Wouldnâ€™t it be great if you could get the compression of a JPEG and keep the transparency of a PNG? Well, you can, sort of.Â Hereâ€™s a little trick that I discovered while working on the new<a href="http://sapporobeer.ca" target="_blank"> Sapporo Beer website.</a>

Notice how the beer can on the Sapporo website has a transparent area (itâ€™s hard to notice but thereâ€™s a video playing behind it).Â As a PNG, the beer can graphic would have been over 1.2 MB!Â So how did I get it down to 271KB?

First, I created two files. The first is a regular JPEG without any transparency. You can compress this one as much as you like. The second is an 8-bit PNG (alpha mask). This is just a black and white image that represents the transparent areas of the beer can. Notice how the PNG is only 11KB; thatâ€™s because it contains so few colors and no transparency.

Next, I created a little snippet of inline SVG:

```xml
<svg preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 560 1388">
  <defs>
    <mask id="canTopMask">
      <image width="560" height="1388" xlink:href="img/can-top-alpha.png"></image>
    </mask>
  </defs>
  <image mask="url(#canTopMask)" id="canTop" width="560" height="1388" xlink:href="can-top.jpg"></image>
</svg>
```

Here I am loading the two images inside an SVG container. The alpha channel image is included as a mask which is then applied to the JPEG to create the transparent region.Â <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The result? A transparent image with JPEG compression!</span>
## Caveats
- [To work in most browsers](http://codepen.io/shshaw/full/IDbqC/) the SVG must be inline. You canâ€™t move it into an external file and load it with an `<img>` tag.
- No IE8 support
- Masks donâ€™t work in older versions of Android
