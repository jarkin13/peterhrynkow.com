Normally, an image looks distorted or pixelated after being enlarged â€” especially if it contains a graphic like a logo or text â€” but the technique I'm about to show you is all about blowing up tiny images and the results might surprise you.

Letâ€™s say you want to use this image as a full page background on your website:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080.jpg" />
`1920x1080.jpg (23 KB)`

Hereâ€™s how you can significantly reduce its file size:
1. Downsample the image so its dimensions are `16x9`
1. Export the image as a PNG. The resulting file <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/16x9.png" /> should be under `1 KB`.
1. Use the `16x9` image as a CSS background image:
```css
.my-background {
  width: 1920px;
  height: 1080px;
  background: url(16x9.png);
  background-size: cover;
}
```
or as an `<img>` element:
```xml
  <img src="16x9.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
```

Here is the result:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/16x9.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`16x9.png (307 bytes)`


Can you tell the difference? As you can see, when the browser upsamples the small image, the result looks almost identical to the original. Here is a [side by side comparison](). Now the background image is only `307 bytes` â€” thatâ€™s a `98.6%`reduction ðŸŽ‰.

Here is another example:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080-2.jpg" />
`1920x1080-2.jpg (143 KB)`

Notice how this image has a bit more detail than the previous one. In this case, the small image will need to be a bit larger `(128x72)` to capture the detail. Finding the right size takes some experimenting.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/16x9-2.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`16x9-2.png (7 KB)`

### Limitations

Before you get too excited, this technique works well for images with smooth gradients and few details, but look what happens if you blow up this image:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1920x1080-3.jpg" />
`1920x1080-3.jpg (337 KB)`

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/16x9-3.png" style="width: 100%; height auto;" />
`16x9-3.png (21 KB)`


### Whatâ€™s going on here?

_Disclaimer: I know very little about image scaling algorithms so please excuse my ignorance when I try to explain how this works._

When the small image is enlarged, the browser uses an [interpolation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling#Algorithms) to fill in the missing image data. Images with few details yield better results because there is less data to interpolate.

### Final thoughts

You might want to consider this technique the next time you export a huge background image from Photoshop or Sketch. If the image contains few details, you might be able to reduce its file size.p
